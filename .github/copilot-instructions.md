## Copilot / Agent Instructions (pointer)

If a task requests a specific section, read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root and apply its rules. Load and follow only that section before starting work.

AGENTS.md headers (use these exact section names when referencing):

* `General`
* `Coding & Tests`
* `Run & Architecture`

For expanded developer guidance, see `docs/developer.md` (Build Script, Running on Localhost, Application Architecture, DB migrations, test coverage).

Keep this file short; use `AGENTS.md` as the canonical source-of-truth. Update both files together when changing rules.
