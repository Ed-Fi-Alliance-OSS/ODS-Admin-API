## Copilot / Agent Instructions (pointer)

If a task requests a specific section (for "Formatting", "Builds", "SetUp", "Testing", "Development" or "DataBase Operations"), read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root and apply its rules. Load and follow only that section before starting work.

For expanded developer guidance, see `docs/developer.md`. That document includes more detailed bullets and procedures.

Keep this file short; use `AGENTS.md` as the canonical source-of-truth. Update both files together when changing rules.
